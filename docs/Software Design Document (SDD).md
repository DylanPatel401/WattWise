# Software Design Document (SDD)

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed design for the Energy Usage Analysis System based on the requirements specified in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS).

### 1.2 Scope
This document covers the architectural design, components, modules, and interfaces of the system required to implement the features outlined in the SRS.

## 2. System Architecture
### 2.1 Overview
The Energy Usage Analysis System will be designed as a web application following a client-server architecture. It will consist of a frontend interface for user interaction and a backend server for data processing and storage.

## 3. Design Considerations
### 3.1 Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React framework)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: Firebase
- **Visualization**: Chart.js for generating charts and graphs

### 3.2 Security
- Firebase security rules

### 3.3 Performance
- Optimization of data parsing and visualization algorithms

## 4. Detailed Design
### 4.1 Frontend Design
#### 4.1.1 User Interface Components
- Login and registration forms
- Data upload interface
- Dashboard for visualizations and reports

#### 4.1.2 User Interaction Flow
